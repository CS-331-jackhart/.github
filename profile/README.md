## Course Catalog Description 
Fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence using the unifying theme of an intelligent agent. Topics include agent architectures, search, games, logic and reasoning, and Bayesian networks.

## Prerequisites
CS 325. Fluency in a programming language, preferably Python. Calculus

 ## Student Learning Outcomes

* Analyze the dimensions along which agents and environments vary, along with key functions that must be implemented in a general agent.
* Implement agents using search algorithms such as uninformed search, informed search or local search.
* Develop strategies for agents in games of perfect and imperfect information.
* Represent knowledge of the world using logic and infer new facts from that knowledge.
* Use a Bayesian network to make quantitative (probabilistic) and qualitative inferences.
* Implement a Bayesian network that solves a simple version of a problem such as text categorization or object recognition.

## Learning Resources

Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd edition), by Russell and Norvig (optional, but recommended).

## Evaluation of Student Performance

An approximate weighting of the marks in the course is listed below. This may change slightly depending on the number and size of the assignments.

* Programming Assignments (3 of them) - 30%
* Written Assignments (5 of them; drop the lowest) - 20%
* Quizzes (6 of them; drop the lowest) - 10%
* Midterm - 20%
* Final - 20%

The midterm and exam are open-book. Only print materials are permitted. Hand-held calculators are also allowed, but no laptops or phones. Do not rely too heavy on your notes during an exam! Use them as a safety net.

Past Grading Scale (I expect to be more liberal):

    A: 93-100
    A-: 90-93
    B+: 87-90
    B: 83-87
    B-: 80-83
    C+: 77-80
    C: 73-77
    C-: 70-73
    D+: 67-70
    D: 63-67
    D-: 60-63
    F: below 60

Policy on collaboration

* You can work in teams of 2-3 for programming assignments and homework.
* If you are in a team, please declare all the members of your team, and submit one assignment or homework per team.
* You are all responsible to contribute to the team work and be able to answer questions on the work you submitted.
* Please declare a statement about contributions of each team members for each assignment/homework.
* Please feel free to use the discussion forum to ask and answer questions of non-homework related topics.

Things not allowed:

* No use of code, documentation, or other written media from sources other than yourself (e.g., classmates, internet, etc.) unless explicitly allowed by the assignment.
* Do not collaborate or discuss answers with students outside your team on homework/programming. 

For further details, please refer to the OSU Academic dishonesty policy and the CS Academic dishonesty policy.

## Late Policy

Homeworks and programming assignments are due at midnight on the due date. The late policy is as follows:

* 0-24 hours late: 90% of the final score
* 24-48 hours late: 50% of the final score
* After 48 hours late: 0%

Note: In-class quizzes are exempt from the late policy. Late submissions will not be accepted.

**Academic Calendar:** All students are subject to the registration and refund deadlines as stated in the Academic Calendar: https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/osu-academic-calendar

 

**Reach Out for Success:** University students encounter setbacks from time to time. If you encounter difficulties and need assistance, it’s important to reach out. Consider discussing the situation with an instructor or academic advisor. Learn about resources that assist with wellness and academic success at oregonstate.edu/ReachOut. If you are in immediate crisis, please contact the Crisis Text Line by texting OREGON to 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255)

 

## Statement Regarding Students with Disabilities

Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations.

 

## Religious Holiday Statement

Oregon State University strives to respect all religious practices. If you have religious holidays that are in conflict with any of the requirements of this class, please see me immediately so that we can make alternative arrangements.


## Student Bill of Rights

OSU has twelve established student rights. They include due process in all university disciplinary processes, an equal opportunity to learn, and grading in accordance with the course syllabus:

## Community Statement  (Thanks to Eric Walkingshaw for this text.)

Every student should feel safe and welcome to contribute in this course. As the instructor, I will try to establish this tone whenever possible, but ultimately the responsibility for cultivating a safe and welcoming community belongs to the students-that means you!

Fortunately, being part of a safe and welcoming community is not too hard. A good place to start is to recognize (and continually remind yourself) of the following facts:

* Your classmates come from a variety of cultural, economic, and educational backgrounds. Something that is obvious to you may not be obvious to them.
* Your classmates are human beings with intelligence and emotions. This applies even if you are interacting anonymously on Canvas.
* Your classmates are here to learn. They have the right to pursue their education without being distracted by others' disruptive behavior, or made uncomfortable by inappropriate jokes or unwanted sexual interest.

If each of us remembers these facts and act with corresponding decency, respect, and professionalism, the course will certainly be better for everyone.

Some students might be inclined to shrug this off and perhaps crack a joke about safe spaces or political correctness. If that's you, please also know that if you make a fellow student uncomfortable by mocking them, making inappropriate jokes, or making unwanted advances, that is harassment and will be taken seriously. (If you are a victim of harassment, please see the brief list of resources below.)

However, I hope that we can all approach this positively. Treat your classmates as respected colleagues, support each other when needed, have fun without spoiling it for anyone else, and everybody wins.

If you are the victim of harassment in this class, there are several resources available to you:

 * You may schedule a private meeting to talk to me.
 * You may contact the University Ombuds Officefor confidential guidance and advice.
 * You may contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Accessto file an informal or formal complaint.

You may also want to read OSU's policies on bullying and on sexual harassment and misconduct.

## Policy on Children in Class  (Thanks to Melissa Cheyney for this text.)

It is my belief that if we want women in academia, that we should also expect children to be present in some form. Currently, the university does not have a formal policy on children in the classroom. The policy described here is thus, a reflection of my own beliefs and commitments to student, staff and faculty parents.

All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between feeding their baby and continuing their education. You and your nursing baby are welcome in class anytime.

For older children and babies, I understand that minor illnesses and unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child and leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.

I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status.

In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates.

Finally, I understand that often the largest barrier to completing your coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. The struggles of balancing school, childcare and often another job are exhausting! I hope that you will feel comfortable disclosing your student-parent status to me. This is the first step in my being able to accommodate any special needs that arise. While I maintain the same high expectations for all student in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you strive for school-parenting balance. Thank you for the diversity you bring to our classroom!

 

## Student Evaluation of Courses

The online Student Evaluation of Teaching system is open to students the Monday of dead week and closes the following Sunday. Students will receive notification, instructions, and the link through their ONID. Students may also log into the system via Online Services. Course evaluation results are extremely important and are used to help improve courses and the learning experience of future students. Responses are anonymous (unless a student chooses to “sign” their comments agreeing to relinquish anonymity), and unavailable to instructors until after grades have been posted. The results of scaled questions and signed comments go to both the instructor and their unit head/supervisor. Anonymous (unsigned) comments go to the instructor only. I am very interested in your feedback on ways to improve the course, and specific feedback is most helpful (which particular aspects of the course went well or poorly for you).
